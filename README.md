## üß≠ How AR Navigation Works

The AR navigation system has been re-architected for accuracy and reliability.

1.  **Permissions & Calibration:** The user is first prompted to grant camera and motion sensor permissions. Then, a mandatory calibration screen guides the user to rotate their device, which helps stabilize the magnetometer (compass) for an accurate heading.
2.  **Sensor Fusion & Smoothing:** The app uses a custom `useDeviceSensors` hook that reads from the `deviceorientation` API. To prevent a jittery arrow, it applies a moving average filter to the raw compass heading, providing a smooth but responsive orientation.
3.  **Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR):** Instead of manual buttons, the system uses the device's accelerometer (`devicemotion`) to automatically detect steps. A peak-detection algorithm with a lockout period ensures that steps are counted accurately.
4.  **Accurate Arrow Pointing:** The core of the system is its arrow logic. The arrow's on-screen rotation is calculated with the formula `relativeBearing = normalizeAngle(destinationBearing - deviceHeading)`. This ensures the arrow visually **rotates with the device**, while its direction always **points to the destination's real-world bearing**.
5.  **Developer Mode & Testing:** A "Dev Mode" toggle is available within the AR view. This enables a debug overlay showing live sensor data. It also allows developers to manually set a simulated device heading to easily test navigation logic, such as the "296¬∞ case" outlined below.

### Testing the "296¬∞ Case"
1.  Navigate to the AR feature on a mobile device.
2.  Enable the "Dev Mode" toggle in the header.
3.  The debug overlay will appear. The destination bearing (`B_dest`) is hardcoded to **296¬∞**.
4.  Use the slider in the debug overlay to set the simulated heading (`H_device`) to **296¬∞**.
5.  **Observe:** The `relative` bearing should be `0¬∞`, and the arrow on screen should point straight up.
6.  Change the simulated heading to **206¬∞**.
7.  **Observe:** The `relative` bearing should be `90¬∞`, and the arrow on screen should point directly to the right.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **AI/ML:**
    - Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`) for the AI companion and quote generation.
- **Web APIs:**
    - `getUserMedia` (Camera API)
    - `DeviceOrientationEvent` & `DeviceMotionEvent` (Motion Sensors)
    - `SpeechRecognition` (Voice Input)
    - `MediaRecorder` (Audio Recording)

### Performance & Data Handling Notes
- **Audio:** To ensure performance and avoid bloating memory, audio data is handled using `Blob` objects and `URL.createObjectURL()`. **Base64 encoding is explicitly avoided for audio data** as it is inefficient. This approach is used for both recording and playback of voice messages.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or newer recommended)
- `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm` package manager
- A valid **Google Gemini API Key**. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/memora-app.git
    cd memora-app
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project. This file will hold your secret API key. Add your Gemini API key to it like this:
    ```
    VITE_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
    ```
    *This is a crucial step. The AI features will not work without it.*

## üèÉ Running the Development Server

### For Desktop Development

You can start the server immediately for development on your computer.

1.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
2.  **Open in your browser:**
    Navigate to the local HTTPS URL provided (e.g., `https://localhost:5173`). Your browser will show a security warning because the SSL certificate is self-signed. You can safely click "Advanced" and proceed to the site.

### For Mobile Device Testing (Recommended)

To test features like the camera, AR navigation, and fall detection, you **must** run the app on a physical mobile device using a trusted SSL certificate.

This is a **one-time setup** that creates a trusted certificate on your machine.

1.  **Install `mkcert`:**
    Follow the official instructions for your operating system on the [mkcert repository](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert). On macOS with Homebrew, for example, run: `brew install mkcert`.

2.  **Create a local Certificate Authority:**
    In your terminal, run the following command. You may be prompted for your password.
    ```bash
    mkcert -install
    ```

3.  **Generate Certificate Files:**
    In the root directory of this project, run:
    ```bash
    mkcert localhost
    ```
    This creates two files: `localhost.pem` and `localhost-key.pem`. The dev server will automatically detect and use them.

4.  **Run the Server & Connect:**
    a. Make sure your computer and mobile phone are on the **same Wi--Fi network**.
    b. Start the dev server:
       ```bash
       npm run dev
       ```
    c. The terminal will output a "Network" URL (e.g., `https://192.168.1.10:5173`).
    d. Open your phone's browser and go to that Network URL. The page should load securely without any warnings.
    e. Grant camera and motion sensor permissions when prompted.

## üì± Building for Android with Capacitor (APK)

Follow these steps to package the web app into a native Android APK file that you can install directly on a device.

### Prerequisites

-   [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) installed on your machine.

### 1. Install Capacitor Dependencies

In your project's root directory, run the following commands to add Capacitor's command-line tool (CLI), core library, and the Android platform library.

```bash
npm install @capacitor/cli @capacitor/core @capacitor/android
```

### 2. Add the Android Platform

Capacitor will now generate a complete native Android project inside your project.

```bash
npx cap add android
```

This creates a new `android` folder in your project. This is a real Android project that you can open in Android Studio.

### 3. Build Your Web App

Create a production-ready build of your React app. This command bundles all your code into a `dist` folder, which is what the native app will use.

```bash
npm run build
```

### 4. Sync Your Web Build with Android

This command copies your web files from the `dist` folder into the native Android project. You should run this command every time you make changes to your web code and want to update the native app.

```bash
npx cap sync android
```
Capacitor will also try to automatically configure permissions in the Android project based on the Web APIs you use (like camera and microphone).

### 5. Open the Project in Android Studio

Now, you can open your native Android project.

```bash
npx cap open android
```

This will launch Android Studio and load your project.

### 6. Build the APK in Android Studio

Once the project is open and has finished its initial sync/build (this can take a few minutes the first time), you can create the APK.

1.  In the Android Studio top menu, go to **Build** -> **Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)** -> **Build APK(s)**.
2.  Android Studio will start building. Once it's finished, a small notification will pop up in the bottom-right corner.
3.  Click the **"locate"** link in the notification to open the folder containing your brand new APK file. It's usually found in `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.
4.  You can now transfer this `app-debug.apk` file to your Android phone and install it.
